# Zomato Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview

The purpose is to use the different libraries of python i.e., numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. Therefore finding missing values and visualization with piecharts and bargraphs, thus giving observation out of it. The dataset I used is from Kaggle.

## About Dataset
 
The dataset is being retrieved from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shrutimehta/zomato-restaurants-data). THe dataset has 5 json files, one csv and one xls file.
